As a medical student studying in Bangladesh, I am pursuing a career in healthcare. I'm quite interested in philosophical fiction, films, fitness, Music and physiology. Aside from that, I support Linux and the open-source community. Considering how monotonous medical school is, I make an effort to find time for my blog, where I write about a variety of topics that I find interesting.
