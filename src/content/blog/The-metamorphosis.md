### Was Gregor's lechery the cause of his transformation ?

As Gregor Samsa awakes one morning from troubled dreams, he is transformed into a monstrous vermin. Gregor’s transformation into an insect can be seen as a metaphor for his psychological breakdown and mental degradation. Gregor despised his job since it required him to travel more, endure awkward train rides, eat horrible food, interact with strangers, and live a hectic, unloving life. The portrait of the woman in his room symbolizes his alienation and the intimate desires he is longing for.

In the book's final act, when Gregor hears his sister playing the music, it drives him out of his room."Could he be an animal, to be so moved by music?" kafka questions. He is so driven, in fact, that gregor is determined to go right up to his sister, pluck at her skirt, and tell her to come to Gregor’s room and play the violin for him. He would not force her, and she was to stay beside Gregor on his sofa and play for him. Then Gregor would confess his plot to send Grete to the conservatory for Christmas, as well as his intention to play on his sister's feelings by giving her a throat kiss. The dark intentions gregor had in mind are startling and terrifying. 

"<u>...After this declaration, his sister would burst into tears of emotion, and Gregor would draw himself up to her oxter and kiss her on the throat...</u>"

Also, out of all the things his father could have hurled at Gregor, why the apples? The apple is a symbolic reference to Adam's suffering from eating it. In the story too, the apple that lodges in between Gregor's head and torso causes infection, which inflicts great pain on Gregor and ends up taking his life. The apple did agonize gregor, but for the sin he had committed. Early in the morning, when the director was at gregor's door, he heard his sister cry.

“<u>...She had presumably only just got up and hadn’t started getting dressed yet. And then, why was she crying?...</u>”

She was too young to be grieving about Gregor losing his job, Gregor explains. Why was she sobbing for no apparent reason? It is probable that right before his metamorphosis, he sexually abused his sister. I think this was gregor's sin, which resulted in his metamorphosis and the extreme misery and despair that accompanied it.

Mr. Samsa's anger towards gregor just after his transformation and his efforts to keep gregor away from his wife and daughter suggest he is aware of what gregor has done. Gregor’s mother and sister are also disgusted and afraid of him. gregor's sister initially, out of pity for his mother, takes care of him, but later in the book, she doesn't regard him as her brother and forsakes him. After his passing, the family thanks God for his demise; they feel they were finally relieved of fear of gregor and all the troubles he caused.

## Conclusion

I believe that Gregor's metamorphosis and tragedy are the outcome of his own actions. Since he was the one who worked long hours to support the family for which they were not very grateful Gregor's constant isolation and lack of affection caused him to lose his mind and commit a henious act. The idea that gregor is a lecherous beast is speculative and is not supported by any substantial evidence in the book. Nevertheless, Kafka illustrated the aspect of absurdity by showing Gregor's strange and inexplicable transformation into an insect. The story tells us how sometimes in life we are met with conditions that we cannot avoid and can do nothing about. It is fascinating how Kafka expresses the dehumanizing aspects of modern life, particularly regarding work, family obligations, and societal acceptance in modern society.
