### A Neurosurgeon's Crisis
<u>"...I FLIPPED THROUGH THE CT scan images, the diagnosis obvious: the lungs were matted with innumerable tumors, the spine deformed, a   full lobe of the liver obliterated. Cancer, widely disseminated. I was a neurosurgical resident entering my final year of training Over the last six years, I’d examined scores of such scans, on the off chance that some procedure might `benefit the patient. But this scan was different: it was my own..."</u>

This is the story of the late Dr. Paul Kalanithi, a final-year neurosurgery resident doctor from Stanford University who had been diagnosed with terminal metastatic lung cancer. Aside from being a neurosurgeon, he had a critical interest in literature and philosophy. Dr. Paul's transition from doctor to patient forced him to confront his mortality and question the meaning of life in the certainty of death.

After his diagnosis of cancer, his hopes and dreams shattered. He was desperately trying to figure out the time he had remaining. During his visit to the doctor regarding his prognosis, Paul would always bring the Kaplan-Meier curve. He had initially accepted his fate and was ready to face it all and had wished for his wife to remarry after his demise. Everything changed during his prognosis with Dr. Emma (Paul's oncologist), who was like a beacon of hope for Paul. She made Paul believe that he could do more than he thinks regardless of the limited time he has on his hands. 

The remaining months he had—what did it mean for him? A neurosurgeon, a father, a teacher? Despite his illness, he returned to his neurosurgery rounds and also kept his love for literature and wrote this book. Paul and Lucy (his wife) had a child together. After his diagnosis, he wished for children; maybe that would hold some meaning to his life, to add another chair to the family's table. In the book he also expresses his grief about how his terminal illness may have at least brought him and Lucy close and saved his marriage. Paul believed that an easy death was not necessarily the best outcome, and he felt that life was not simply about avoiding suffering.

<u>"...You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving...”</u>

Paul began writing the book after his diagnosis and continued until he could no longer gather the strength to write. His love for literature shaped his perspective on life and death, allowing him to convey profound insights through his words. As he penned `his thoughts, he hoped to leave behind a legacy that would resonate with others facing similar struggles

## Personal Reflections

As a second-year medical student, I found reading the posthumous book 'When Breath Becomes Air' to be both enthralling and deeply sentimental. It certainly left a profound impact on my psyche. I began realizing that being a doctor in clinical practice is going to be a different reality from being a medical student in the classroom. I've always had my doubts about my subjective curriculum, as I am yet to be exposed to the clinical sciences. I find myself contemplating diagrams of the textbooks, thinking, "Will it really be as colorful, traced, and guided?" Another thing the book made me comprehend is the gravity of judgment. The ability to make decisions at the most vulnerable times. It made me reflect on the moments of my life where I struggled to reach a conclusion. Life and death is an abstract concept to me, but will it be so if I were to make a judgment for it? What does it take to be certain about it: knowledge, wisdom, morality, or clarity?
