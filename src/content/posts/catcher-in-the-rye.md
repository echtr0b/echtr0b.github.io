# An adolocent in a world full of phonies ? 

Holden Caulfield, the book's youthful protagonist, is in his prime adolescent years and far too innocent for this sort of transition period, in which most people are insecure, emotionally unstable, and lack a clear sense of purpose and orientation. The novel is remarkably well-written and depicts a significant stage of life that we all experience.

The title of the book, CATCHER IN THE RYE, comes from a conversation between Holden and his little sister Phoebe. His innocence is reflected in the conversation between him and his sister Phoebe. He misinterprets the poem "Body meet a body comin' through the rye" as "Body catch a body coming through the rye." He then proceeds to explain to Phoebe that he views himself as a catcher in the rye where children are playing. He stands at the edge of the cliff and makes sure no children fall from the cliff. This shows Holden's will to protect the children's innocence, protect them from the dangers of the world, and stop them from the depression accompanied in the process. We can get a hint of Holden's innocence and goodness from the subtle act of him cleaning the slang off the walls in Phoebe's school. He views the world as shallow and depressing, filled with phonies and posers. He has developed a sort of savior-type complex. He feels like he’s the only one who understands the importance of protecting children’s innocence, but in doing so, he isolates himself.

>...I'd pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes. That way I wouldn't have to have any goddam stupid useless conversations with anybody. If anybody wanted to tell me something, they'd have to write it on a piece of paper and shove it over to me. They'd get bored as hell doing that after a while, and then I'd be through with having conversations for the rest of my life. Everybody'd think I was just a poor deaf-mute bastard and they'd leave me alone...

Apart from all this, Holden is kind of delusional; he is scared to grow up, to face the challenges, and to deal with people. It's absurd how, in one part of the book, he mentions that if he were deaf and mute, he would also marry a deaf mute. In his painted reality, if he fathered children, he would hide them from the world and self-educate them.  He masks his insecurity by acting all tough and swearing a lot. Holden is also insecure about dating and maintaining a healthy relationship, as he loves Jane Gallenger but is not able to confront her about his feelings. Also, with Sally Hughes, he is not certain and gets intimidated by her unwillingness to accept Holden's idea to escape to a new city and build a new life. Holden doesn't understand that everyone is unique and has their own desires.

## Holden's Redemption

It's hard to deny that Phoebe was Holden's ultimate redemption. The conversation with Phoebe, Where she questions his actions and corrects his delusion on the whole catcher thing—that was emotional. She confronted Holden about his fear of facing the world and reality. The final part of the book felt overwhelming to me. The moment when Holden decides to leave everything behind for good and meets Phoebe for the last time is significant. In that moment, the weight of his choices became painfully clear, as he realized how deeply he cared for her and the innocence she represented. The moment when Phoebe gets on the carousel and Holden watches, he is redeemed. He becomes the catcher in the rye, which is what he had wished for. He sees everyone on the carousel trying to grab the golden ring, even Phoebe. He is scared that she might fall off, but he doesn't force himself to restrict them.  He finally understands that change is necessary; one may face complexities growing up and coping with the world, and he should not hinder the process or try to prevent it.
